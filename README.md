# WordPress Personal Blog

This repository contains a WordPress installation with a custom theme, helper plugin, and deployment automation for GoDaddy hosting. Use Docker Compose for local development, GitHub Actions for shipping updates to a live GoDaddy site, and the bundled Nextend Social Login integration to offer Google sign-in.

## Local Development (Docker Compose)

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (or compatible Docker Engine) with Compose support.

### Start the stack
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
- WordPress is available at http://localhost:8080.
- First launch triggers the standard WordPress installer—create an admin account as prompted.
- Default database credentials (provisioned in Compose):
  - host: `db`
  - name/user/password: `wordpress`

Composer creates two persistent volumes:
- `./wp-content` mounts straight into the container so theme/plugin edits are reflected live.
- `db_data` keeps MySQL data between restarts. To reset everything, run `docker compose down -v`.

### Useful commands
- Stop containers: `docker compose stop`
- Remove containers (keeping volumes): `docker compose down`
- Tail logs: `docker compose logs -f wordpress`

```
Adjust the container name if you renamed the project.

## Deploy to GoDaddy with GitHub Actions

The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-wp-content.yml` syncs `wp-content` to an existing GoDaddy WordPress site. Before you push to `main` or trigger a manual run, configure these repository secrets in GitHub:

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GD_SFTP_HOST` | GoDaddy SFTP hostname |
| `GD_SFTP_USER` | SFTP username |
| `GD_SFTP_PASSWORD` | SFTP password |
| `GD_SFTP_PORT` (optional) | SFTP port, defaults to `22` |
| `GD_REMOTE_PATH` | Root directory of your GoDaddy WordPress install (e.g. `html` or `html/subdir`) |

What the workflow does:
1. Compresses `wp-content` into `wp-content.tar.gz`.
2. Uploads the archive via SCP to `/tmp` on your GoDaddy host.
3. Over SSH, creates a timestamped backup of the existing `wp-content`, extracts the new archive to a temporary folder, and uses `rsync` to sync changes (core caches/uploads are excluded).
4. Cleans up the archive and temp folders.

Triggering the deployment:
- Push commits to the `main` branch that touch `wp-content/**`.
- Or run the workflow manually from the GitHub “Actions” tab (`workflow_dispatch`).

After a run, check the workflow logs and verify the updated files on GoDaddy before clearing caches.

## Google Sign-In Configuration

The repository bundles the Nextend Social Login plugin (`wp-content/plugins/nextend-facebook-connect`) and a must-use loader (`wp-content/mu-plugins/social-login-bootstrap.php`) that reads credentials from environment variables or constants.

### 1. Activate the plugin
- In `wp-admin`, go to Plugins → Installed Plugins and ensure **Nextend Social Login** is activated. The MU plugin loads automatically once Nextend is active.

### 2. Create Google OAuth credentials
1. Open Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials.
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen and add `tuno.world` as an Authorized domain (verify ownership if prompted).
3. Create OAuth credentials of type **Web application**.
4. Add redirect URIs that match your environments:
   - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php?loginSocial=google`
   - Local (optional): `http://localhost:8080/wp-login.php?loginSocial=google`
5. Note the generated Client ID and Client Secret.

### 3. Provide credentials to WordPress
Supply the keys via `wp-config.php` or environment variables. Any of the following names work (the loader checks all of them):
```php
define('SOCIAL_LOGIN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID', 'your-google-client-id');
define('SOCIAL_LOGIN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET', 'your-google-client-secret');
```
You can also set `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` as environment variables in Docker, on GoDaddy, or via your hosting control panel.

After saving the credentials, visit `wp-admin → Nextend Social Login → Providers → Google` and click “Verify Settings” to confirm Google recognizes the redirect URI. Once verified, a “Continue with Google” button appears on `/wp-login.php` and any other login forms.

### 4. Test the flow
- Browse to https://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php?loginSocial=google and ensure Google renders the consent screen.
- If you see `Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch`, confirm the URI matches exactly (scheme, host, path, query) in Google Cloud Console.

## Additional Notes
- Custom theme files live in `wp-content/themes/my-custom-theme`.
- Custom functionality is in `wp-content/plugins/my-custom-plugin`.
- The `build` directory includes artifacts for manual deployments if needed (GoDaddy package, database dump).
